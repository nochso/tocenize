[Unreleased]
------------

### Fixed
- Unicode letters were missing from anchor links. They are now included but not
  lower cased.

### Changed
- Updating files successfully will exit with status code 0.
  `-t` will still exit with `tocenize.ExitDiff` when a file differs.

[0.3.1] - 2017-01-22
--------------------

### Fixed
- Inline `[link]`s are now stripped from TOC titles.
- Ignore headings inside fenced code blocks.

### Changed
- Exit code is 1 when any files have changed or need to change. When nothing
  has changed or needs to change, the exit code is zero.


[0.3.0] - 2016-12-03
--------------------

### Added
- New flag `-indent` to change the indentation string for nested lists (default `\t`)

### Removed
- Removed verbosity flag `-v` and is now used for version display.

### Changed
- Flag `-V` is now `-v`, replacing verbosity.
- Diffs are now colourful and limited to 3 lines of context.


[0.2.0] - 2016-11-20
--------------------

### Added
- Added flag `-e` to update only existing TOCs.

### Changed
- `Document.Update()` now returns `Document, error` instead of just `error`
- Insert new line when inserting a TOC for the first time.
- Markdown is stripped from anchors and link texts.
    - Link texts get stripped of images and links (excl. text)
    - Anchors are stripped of all Markdown.
- Parse given file paths using [`filepath.Glob`](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Glob).

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong behaviour of CRLF endings because of ineffectual assignment.
- Duplicate headings did not have unique anchor links. They are now numbered
  the same way as Github does it.

### Removed
- Removed flag `-u`. Updating is still used as a default when other flags are
  not set.


[0.1.0] - 2016-11-06
